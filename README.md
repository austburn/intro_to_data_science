# Intro To Data Analysis
This is just a repository to keep track of my progress in the Udacity course [Intro To Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud359).

To start, you'll need:
* python
* pip

To start:
* ```git clone https://github.com/austburn/intro_to_data_science.git```
* ```cd intro_to_data_science```
* ```. env/bin/activate```
* ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

#Note
If you have trouble with aquiring ```statsmodels``` or ```scipy```, refer to this [Stack Overflow Post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7496547/does-python-scipy-need-blas). Being on Ubuntu, the second answer is actually what helped me. For convenience, you need to:

```sudo apt-get install gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev```

To aquire some linear algebra libraries.
